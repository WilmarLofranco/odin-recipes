# ODIN RECIPES

This is the [first project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) in the Odin Project course about web development. The project consists of a simple website that shows recipes. It will consist of a main page and a couple of other pages, connected by hyperlinks on a main webpage, that will include some recipes of my choosing.
